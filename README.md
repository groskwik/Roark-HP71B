# Roark for HP-71B Calculator
Roarks's Formula for Stress and Strain
http://materiales.azc.uam.mx/gjl/Clases/MA10_I/Roark%27s%20formulas%20for%20stress%20and%20strain.pdf

## Purpose

This program computes the Shear, Moment, Slope, and deflection for Elastic Straight Beams as defined in Table 8.1 of Roarks's Formula for Stress and Strain.
The following cases are implemented:

* Concentrated intermediate load: Case 1a to 1f are implemented
* Partial distributed load: Case 2a to 2f are implemented

## Usage
The program asks for the inputs. The variable names are the same as defined in the Roark's. See demo below:

## Outputs
The program computes:
- The reaction forces at beam supports
- The bending moment at beam supports
- The maximal bending moment (along the beam, can be less than on the support)
- The maximal deflection
- The deflection along the beam for a given range
- The moment along the beam for a given range
- The shear force along the beam for a given range

## Computation of a single value
Once the program as ran one time, it is possible to compute a single value on any location of the beam.
Examples:
* Case 1 (a through f). Computes the Shear Force at location x=10.2:
 ```bas
         FNV1(10.2)
```      
* Same for respectively Slope, Moment and Deflection:
 ```bas
         FNT1(10.2)
         FNM1(10.2)   
         FNY1(10.2)
```      
* Case 2 (a through f). Same as above but the function name ends with "2":
 ```bas
         FNV2(10.2)
```      

## Requirements
This program uses the Math Rom. The module shall be properly installed on your calculator.
If you follow the instruction below for installation, you will also need the Math Rom installed in EMU71.
See EMU71 help for how to install the Rom into the emulator.

## Installation
There are several methods to copy the program to the HP-71B Calculator.
The one described below uses the PILBOX http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/hpil/ and EMU71 http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/emu71/.
The description below is derived from http://www.namirshammas.com/HP71B/EMU71.htm.

1. Copy the code, renaming it to emu_in.dat, to Emu71's home directory.
2. Enter this program in Emu71 (or copy it from the repositery, see readdat file)
```bas
10 DIM A$[100]
20 DELAY .1
30 INPUT "FILENAME? ";F$
40 CREATE TEXT F$
50 ASSIGN #1 TO F$
60 ENTER :DOSLINK ;A$
70 DISP A$
80 PRINT #1;A$
90 GOTO 40
```
3. Run the program in EMU71. The program prompts for a name. It will be the name of the ROARK program in EMU71.
4. Close the file by executing from the keyboard:
```bas
        ASSIGN #1 to *
```
5. The text file is now in the emulated HP-71B file system, as a proper HP-71B TEXT file, with the name you chose. You can now transform it to a BASIC program by executing from the keyboard (replace ROARK with the name you chose before):
```bas
         TRANSFORM ROARK INTO BASIC
```
6. You can now copy the file to HDRIVE1 by executing from the keyboard (replace ROARK with the name you chose):
```bas
         COPY ROARK TO ":HDRIVE1"
```
7. The file HDRIVE1.dat is now able to be used to transfer directly its content with the PILBOX. Go to your ILPER folder and replace the HDRIVE1.dat file from ILPER with the one from EMU71 (backup the old one before if needed). Connect you HP-71B to the PILBOX, run ILPER, and execute the following command on your (real) HP-71B:
```bas
         COPY "ROARK:HDRIVE1"
```
8. You can also copy the file from EMU71 to a regular windows text file with the following program (see writedat file):
```bas
10 ENDLINE CHR$(13)&CHR$(10)
20 PRINTER IS :DOSLINK
30 INPUT "FILENAME? ";F$
40 PLIST F$
50 PRINTER IS * (or PRINTER IS :DISPLAY)
```
9. Close the file by executing from the keyboard:
```bas
CLEAR :DOSLINK 
```

You'll find a PC text file named "emu_out.dat" in Emu71's home directory.
